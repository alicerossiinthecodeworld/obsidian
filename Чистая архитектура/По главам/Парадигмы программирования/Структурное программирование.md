Structured programming allows modules to be recursively decomposed into
provable units, which in turn means that modules can be functionally
decomposed. That is, you can take a large-scale problem statement and
decompose it into high-level functions. Each of those functions can then be
decomposed into lower-level functions, ad infinitum.
