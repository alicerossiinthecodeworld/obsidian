**Burikko** (ぶりっ子, sometimes rendered **Burriko** in English) is a Japanese term for girls or women who act coy, or deliberately cute and/or innocent in a put-on way. The term was [coined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neologism "Neologism") around 1980, likely by Japanese comedian [Kuniko Yamada](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kuniko_Yamada&action=edit&redlink=1 "Kuniko Yamada (page does not exist)")

Burikko style is often associated with [Japanese idols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_idol "Japanese idol") of the 1980s such as [Seiko Matsuda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seiko_Matsuda "Seiko Matsuda").

(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burikko#cite_note-3) It is associated with the Japanese notion of _[kawaii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawaii "Kawaii")_, meaning "cute", which has become important in modern [Japanese culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_culture "Japanese culture"). Burikko is not so much a style or state of being, but a set of tools employed to mask the self, particularly women's sexuality. This is emphasized in the common phrase _burikko suru_ "to do _burikko".
